# TODO: Code Cleanup and Refactoring

Based on a review of the codebase against the memory bank, the following discrepancies and issues need to be addressed to bring the code in line with the documented architecture.

- [ ] **Consolidate Entry Points:**
    -   **Issue:** The project has two conflicting entry points: `main.ts` and `main-precision.ts`.
    -   **Problem:** They contain redundant initialization logic and conflicting user authentication flows. `main-precision.ts` matches the documented guest-first approach, while `main.ts` contains legacy authentication UI logic.
    -   **Task:** Deprecate and remove `main.ts`. Merge any unique, necessary functionality from `main.ts` into `main-precision.ts` and rename `main-precision.ts` to `main.ts` to make it the single, official entry point.

- [ ] **Remove Unused Guest Authentication Code:**
    -   **Issue:** The `AuthService` in `auth.ts` includes a `signInAsGuest` method.
    -   **Problem:** This method is legacy code from a previous guest implementation that created guest users in the database. The current system correctly uses local storage for guest sessions and does not interact with the database for guests.
    -   **Task:** Remove the `signInAsGuest` method from `auth.ts` to eliminate dead code and prevent future confusion.

- [ ] **Eliminate Redundant Code:**
    -   **Issue:** The dual entry points have led to duplicated code for initializing core components (`Terrain`, `AssignmentManager`, `PrecisionToolManager`, etc.).
    -   **Problem:** This increases maintenance overhead and the risk of inconsistent behavior.
    -   **Task:** As part of consolidating the entry points, refactor the initialization process to remove all duplicated code. Ensure that all components are initialized only once in the new, single entry point.

### Memory Bank vs. Code Discrepancies

- [ ] **Align User Authentication Flow:**
    -   **Issue:** The memory bank accurately states the current app behavior (always guest UI), but the code contains a full, unused authentication system (`auth.ts`, `auth-ui.ts`).
    -   **Problem:** This creates a disconnect where the code's capability is much larger than the user-facing product.
    -   **Task:** Decide whether to fully remove the unused authentication code or integrate it as an optional "Sign Up for Full Features" path. Update the memory bank to reflect the decision.

- [ ] **Integrate Gamification & Progression:**
    -   **Issue:** The memory bank claims a "full leveling system" is complete, but the latest code (`main-precision.ts`, `assignments.ts`) unlocks all levels for solo guest users, bypassing progression.
    -   **Problem:** The primary user flow does not match the documented core feature.
    -   **Task:** Re-evaluate the solo mode. Either integrate the progression system for solo guests (e.g., unlocking levels sequentially) or update the memory bank to clarify that progression is only for "Competition" mode.

- [ ] **Clarify Multiplayer Status:**
    -   **Issue:** `progress.md` lists "Real-time collaborative and competitive gameplay" as complete, but the `activeContext.md` focuses entirely on a solo guest experience.
    -   **Problem:** The user-facing status of the multiplayer feature is unclear.
    -   **Task:** Test the "Competition" mode from the guest UI. Document how it works and update the memory bank to accurately reflect whether it's a fully implemented feature or a backend capability.

- [ ] **Fix Guest Info Persistence Bug:**
    -   **Issue:** The memory bank correctly identifies a bug where guest info is not preserved on page reload.
    -   **Problem:** The code in `main-precision.ts` contains `await supabase.auth.signOut();` on page load, which is the likely cause.
    -   **Task:** Investigate and remove the session-clearing code that is unintentionally affecting guest `localStorage`. Ensure guest data persists across reloads as intended.
