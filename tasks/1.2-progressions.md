# 1.2 Progression System Implementation

## Goal
Implement a simplified progression system with three levels per age bracket, keeping all levels unlocked for easy access. Focus on pass/fail determination and scoring based on objectives met, net zero closeness, and operation efficiency. Integrate with existing assignment, progress, and server systems.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Structure Levels Around Age Brackets
- Group existing assignments into three age brackets (Kids 8-12, Teens 13-25, Adults 26+) with exactly three levels each.
  - Select/adapt assignments: Level 1 (Beginner, e.g., basic foundation on flat terrain), Level 2 (Intermediate, e.g., drainage on gentle slopes), Level 3 (Advanced, e.g., road construction on rough terrain).
- Modify AssignmentManager in assignments.ts to categorize levels by age bracket.
  - Add age_bracket field to AssignmentConfig.
  - Update getUnlockedLevels() to return all levels (1-3) for the user's age bracket, ignoring locks for simplicity.
- Integrate with age-scaling.ts for dynamic adjustments (e.g., UI simplification, tolerances) based on user's selected age range.

### Phase 2: Implement Pass/Fail and Scoring Logic
- Define pass/fail as binary: Pass if all level objectives are met (100% completion or >=80% per objective in updateProgress()).
  - On fail, prompt retry; on pass, compute score and record.
- Enhance scoring in AssignmentManager's updateProgress() and server.js's calculateServerScore().
  - Net Zero Closeness (50% weight): Score = max(0, 100 - (abs(net_volume) * factor)), with age-adjusted tolerance (e.g., higher for kids).
  - Operations Efficiency (50% weight): Score = min(100, (ideal_operations / operations_count) * 100).
  - Total Score: Average of the two, stored in level_attempts.
- Add hand-authored ideal_operations to each level's AssignmentConfig (e.g., 10 for Level 1, 20 for Level 3).

### Phase 3: Database and Server Integration
- Update level_attempts table (via migration if needed) to include age_bracket field for filtering.
- Modify /api/submit-level-attempt in server.js to validate pass/fail server-side and store breakdowns.
  - Ensure volumes are in cubic yards; add anti-cheat checks for operations_count.
- Update user_progress to track bracket completions (e.g., add completed_brackets array).

### Phase 4: UI and User Experience Updates
- In assignment-ui.ts, display all three levels as unlocked; show pass/fail result immediately, then score breakdown (e.g., "Passed! Score: 85/100").
- Add progress indicators per bracket (e.g., 2/3 levels passed).
- Support practice vs. competitive modes: Practice skips scoring; competitive submits to leaderboards with XP.

### Phase 5: Testing and Balance
- Manually test each level in all brackets for pass/fail accuracy and score calculation.
- Balance ideal_operations and tolerances via playtesting.
- Add admin tools (e.g., in dev mode) to tweak level configs.

## Timeline
- Phase 1-2: Day 1 (Core logic).
- Phase 3-4: Day 2 (Integration and UI).
- Phase 5: Day 3 (Testing).

## Success Criteria
- All levels unlocked and accessible per age bracket.
- Accurate pass/fail and scoring with server validation.
- Seamless integration without disrupting existing features.
