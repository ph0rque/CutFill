# Cut/Fill UX/UI Improvements Task List

This task list tracks the implementation of enhanced cut and fill visualizations, including layered sides, refined polyhedra, dynamic arrows, and ensuring no unwanted grid overlays (while keeping contours). Tasks will be marked as [ ] In Progress or [x] Completed as I work through them.

## Task 1: Update Memory Bank for Grayscale Surface and Layered Sides
- Reinforce in activeContext.md: Surface remains grayscale (#444 to #DDD height-based); sides show colored horizontal material layers as per materialLayers.
- Status: [x] Completed (documentation updated)

## Task 2: Ensure No Rectangular Grid Overlays (Keep Contours)
- Verify and remove/disable any potential grid-like elements (e.g., wireframes, patterns) in terrain.ts and main.ts.
- Confirm contours remain togglable as requested.
- Status: [x] Completed

## Task 3: Enhance Side Wall Rendering with Horizontal Elevation Layers
- In terrain.ts, update updateWallColors() and related methods to apply materialLayers colors based on y-height for sides (x-z planes), keeping surface grayscale.
- Test rendering to ensure layers are visible horizontally.
- Status: [x] Completed

## Task 4: Refine Cut Visualization (Red Polyhedron with Flat Bottom)
- Edit createLocalizedCutOverlay() in terrain.ts: Use flat bottom at min current height, top following exact original terrain shape (via ExtrudeGeometry or similar).
- Set red material with 0.3 opacity.
- Status: [x] Completed

## Task 5: Refine Fill Visualization (Blue Polyhedron with Flat Top)
- Edit createLocalizedFillOverlay() in terrain.ts: Use flat top at max current height, bottom following exact original terrain shape.
- Set blue material with 0.3 opacity.
- Status: [x] Completed

## Task 6: Enhance Arrows for Dynamic Distribution and Height Scaling
- In terrain.ts, update arrow creation (e.g., createDensityBasedArrows()): Make evenly distributed, dynamic (update on changes), with arrow length scaling to local cut/fill depth/height.
- Red for cut (downward, inside volume), blue for fill (upward, inside volume).
- Status: [x] Completed

## Task 7: Integration and Testing
- Update main.ts and tools.ts for seamless triggering of new visualizations on tool apply.
- Test overall: Rendering, performance, multiplayer sync, UI toggles.
- Fix any issues and confirm with local run.
- Status: [x] Completed

Progress will be updated in this file as tasks complete. Let me know if adjustments are needed!
