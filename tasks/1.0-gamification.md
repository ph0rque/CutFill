# Plan of Action for Implementing Multi-Level Competitive Gameplay in CutFill

Based on the review of Cursor rules, Memory Bank, and codebase analysis, this plan transforms existing assignments into competitive multi-level gameplay. It **enhances** the already robust system (15+ assignments, XP/leveling, multiplayer) rather than rebuilding, aligning with the Game Week Project timeline and leveraging production-ready components.

The plan repurposes existing assignments as sequential levels, enhances existing competitive assignments, and adds missing competitive features for a 3-5 day implementation.

> **Key clarifications incorporated**  
> â€¢ **Operations** = each cut or fill terrain modification/operation.  
> â€¢ **Existing assignments** will be repurposed as sequential levels with linear progression.  
> â€¢ **Existing competitive assignments** will be enhanced rather than creating separate competitive variants.  
> â€¢ **Server-side validation** will be implemented with DB storage in new `level_attempts` table.  
> â€¢ All level attempts â€“ **practice and competitive** â€“ are written to `level_attempts`; practice rows flagged with `is_practice = true`.  
> â€¢ **Time is *not* a scoring factor**; no enforced time-limit objective.  
> â€¢ Extra **XP is awarded only in competitive mode** (with podium bonuses).  
> â€¢ A **global leaderboard** is required in addition to per-match rankings.  
> â€¢ Level metadata will be centralized in enhanced `assignments.ts` and versioned via `levelVersion`.  
> â€¢ Scores will be **validated server-side** to prevent tampering.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Assignment-to-Level System (2-3 hours)
- **Goal:** Transform existing assignments into sequential levels with operation tracking and server-side validation.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Enhance `AssignmentConfig` interface** in `src/src/assignments.ts`:
     - Add `levelNumber: number` (derived from difficulty and creation order)
     - Add `idealOperations: number` (hand-authored par count for each existing assignment)  
     - Add `levelVersion: number` for future level updates
     - Add `isCompetitive: boolean` flag to identify existing competitive assignments
  2. **Add Operation Counting** to `AssignmentProgress`:
     - Add `operationCount: number` to track each cut/fill modification
     - Add `operationsEfficiencyScore: number` (calculated as `idealOperations / actualOperations * 100`)
     - Integrate counting into existing terrain modification system
  3. **Enhanced Database Schema** (additive approach):
     - Create new `level_attempts` table as planned for comprehensive attempt tracking
     - Add `unlocked_levels` to existing `user_progress` table (leveraging current structure)
     - Keep existing `user_assignments` table for backward compatibility
  4. **Sequential Level Logic**:
     - Sort existing 15+ assignments by difficulty, then by estimated time
     - Implement `getUnlockedLevels()` and `unlockNextLevel()` methods
     - Level 1 (foundation_prep_1) starts unlocked; completing level N unlocks level N+1
- **Rationale:** Leverages existing production-ready assignment system while adding missing level progression and operation tracking.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Competitive Multiplayer (4-6 hours)
- **Goal:** Enhance existing competitive assignments with real-time scoring, lobbies, and global leaderboards.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Enhance Existing Competitive Assignments** in `src/src/assignments.ts`:
     - Identify current competitive assignments (speed_foundation_race, drainage_duel, precision_showdown)
     - Add real-time operation counting display during competitive matches
     - Enhance scoring to include operations efficiency (20%), objectives (50%), net-zero balance (30%)
  2. **Real-Time Competitive Scoring** in `src/src/multiplayer-enhanced.ts`:
     - Extend `GameSession` to include `liveScores` and `currentLevel: number`
     - Implement server-side score calculation and validation
     - Add live leaderboard updates every 2 seconds during competitive matches
     - Handle player disconnections (mark as DNF, score = 0, others continue)
  3. **Enhanced Lobby System** in `src/src/multiplayer-ui.ts`:
     - Add level selection to existing session creation flow
     - Implement "Quick Match" for competitive pairing
     - Require minimum 2 players for competitive matches
     - Add spectator mode for ongoing matches
  4. **Server-Side Validation**:
     - Validate all terrain modifications and scores on server
     - Store every attempt (practice and competitive) in `level_attempts` table
     - Prevent client-side score tampering with authoritative server calculations
- **Rationale:** Builds on existing robust multiplayer foundation while adding missing competitive features and anti-cheat measures.

## Phase 3: Level Selection & UI Enhancements (3-4 hours)
- **Goal:** Transform assignment UI into level selection with practice/competitive modes.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Enhanced Assignment UI** in `src/src/assignment-ui.ts`:
     - Transform existing assignment modal into "Level Selection" interface
     - Show sequential levels with lock/unlock status (ðŸ”’ for locked levels)
     - For each unlocked level, provide two buttons: **"Practice"** and **"Compete"**
     - Practice mode uses existing single-player assignment flow
     - Compete mode initiates multiplayer lobby for that specific level
  2. **Real-Time Competition Display** in `src/src/multiplayer-ui.ts`:
     - Add live leaderboard panel during competitive matches
     - Show operations count, efficiency score, and total score for each player
     - Real-time progress bars for each scoring component
     - Display podium rankings immediately upon completion
  3. **Global Leaderboard System**:
     - Create leaderboard queries using new `level_attempts` table
     - Show best attempts per level (practice and competitive separately)
     - Add "Hall of Fame" for top competitive performers
     - Integration with existing XP/achievement system
  4. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**:
     - Extend existing `UserProgress` interface with `unlockedLevels: number[]`
     - Update existing progress persistence to track level completion
     - Award XP only for competitive completions (practice gives 0 XP)
     - Add podium bonuses: +20% XP for 1st place, +10% for 2nd place
- **Rationale:** Maintains familiar UI patterns while adding clear level progression and competitive features.

## Phase 4: Server-Side Infrastructure & Testing (2-3 hours)
- **Goal:** Implement authoritative server scoring and comprehensive testing.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Server-Side Validation** in `server/server.js`:
     - Add terrain modification validation endpoints
     - Implement authoritative score calculation (matching client algorithms)
     - Store all attempts in `level_attempts` table with server timestamps
     - Add anti-cheat detection for impossible scores or rapid operations
  2. **Database Enhancements**:
     - Deploy `level_attempts` table with proper indexing for leaderboard queries
     - Add migration to update existing `user_progress` with `unlocked_levels`
     - Implement efficient leaderboard queries (indexed on level_id, score)
  3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
     - Test level progression: completing level N unlocks level N+1
     - Test competitive multiplayer: 2-4 player sessions with real-time scoring
     - Test server validation: ensure scores match server calculations
     - Test disconnect handling: remaining players can finish, dropped player gets score 0
     - Verify global leaderboard accuracy and performance
  4. **Performance Optimization**:
     - Ensure 60+ FPS maintained during competitive play (current: 121 FPS)
     - Optimize leaderboard queries for fast loading
     - Test concurrent competitive sessions
- **Rationale:** Ensures system reliability and prevents cheating while maintaining existing performance standards.

## Phase 5: Polish & Documentation (1-2 hours)
- **Steps:**
  1. **Final Testing & Polish**:
     - Edge case testing: score ties, simultaneous completions, rapid disconnects
     - UI polish: smooth transitions between practice/competitive modes
     - Performance validation under competitive load
  2. **Documentation Updates**:
     - Update Memory Bank: `activeContext.md` with new competitive level system
     - Update `progress.md`: mark enhanced multiplayer competition as completed
     - Create `.cursor/rules/competitive-levels.mdc`: document level design patterns
  3. **Demo Preparation**:
     - Update README with level progression and competitive mode instructions
     - Prepare demonstration scenarios showing practiceâ†’competitive progression
     - Document new leaderboard and scoring features

## Enhanced Technical Architecture

### **Operation Counting Integration**
```typescript
// Enhanced AssignmentProgress
interface AssignmentProgress {
  // ... existing fields
  operationCount: number;           // Each cut/fill modification
  operationsEfficiencyScore: number; // (idealOps / actualOps) * 100
}

// Enhanced scoring calculation
const operationsScore = Math.min(100, (idealOperations / actualOperations) * 100);
const finalScore = (objectiveScore * 0.5) + (netZeroScore * 0.3) + (operationsScore * 0.2);
```

### **Level Progression System**
```typescript
// Enhanced AssignmentConfig  
interface AssignmentConfig {
  // ... existing fields
  levelNumber: number;      // Sequential level (1, 2, 3...)
  idealOperations: number;  // Hand-authored par count
  levelVersion: number;     // For future updates
  isCompetitive: boolean;   // Existing competitive assignments
}
```

### **Database Schema (Enhanced)**
```sql
-- New table for comprehensive attempt tracking
CREATE TABLE level_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  level_id TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Assignment ID used as level ID
  level_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  objective_points INTEGER,
  net_zero_points INTEGER, 
  operations_points INTEGER,
  operations_count INTEGER,
  ideal_operations INTEGER,
  net_volume DECIMAL,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  is_practice BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  server_validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enhanced existing user_progress table
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN unlocked_levels INTEGER[] DEFAULT '{1}';

-- Optimized indexes for leaderboards
CREATE INDEX idx_level_attempts_leaderboard ON level_attempts(level_id, score DESC, is_practice);
CREATE INDEX idx_level_attempts_user ON level_attempts(user_id, completed_at);
```
