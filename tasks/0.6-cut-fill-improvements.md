# 0.6 Cut-Fill Improvements – Plan-First / Commit-Later Workflow

## Goal
Allow users to sketch multiple cut/fill areas (visualised with red/blue polyhedra) and only apply them to the terrain once they hit **Save**. Until Save the underlying surface, contours and statistics stay unchanged.

### Task List

- [ ] 1. Data model: add `pendingModifications` array inside `Terrain` to cache each brush stroke (type, center, radius, bounds, heightChange, brushSettings snapshot).
- [ ] 2. Brush logic: in `modifyHeightBrush` & `modifyHeight` skip vertex mutation when _planning_ mode is active; instead generate overlay mesh + push a pendingModification entry.
- [ ] 3. UI: add two buttons to the main toolbar – **Save** and **Cancel** – which only appear when there is at least one pending change.
- [ ] 4. Terrain methods:  
  • `applyPendingChanges()` – loops through the pending list, applies height changes, regenerates blockGeometry, colours, contours, then clears overlays & list.  
  • `discardPendingChanges()` – simply removes overlay meshes and clears the list without touching terrain.
- [ ] 5. Disable live contour/volume updates while in planning mode; provide provisional volume totals based on overlays (optional but desirable).
- [ ] 6. Integrate Save/Cancel with undo stack: a successful _Save_ should push one combined undo state, not each stroke individually.
- [ ] 7. Guard undo/redo and other editing controls when in planning mode (cannot start a new plan while another is pending).
- [ ] 8. Clean up memory – dispose geometries/materials of overlays after Save/Cancel.
- [ ] 9. Update documentation and help text.

**Stretch**
- [ ] Live volume preview panel while planning.
- [ ] Allow individual overlay selection & deletion before commit.
