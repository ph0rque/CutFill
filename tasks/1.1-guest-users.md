# 1.1 Guest Users Implementation

## Overview
Implement a Socket.io-based guest user system for first-time visitors. On initial load, show a form for username (with uniqueness check), age range selection, and choice of solo or competition mode. After submission, create/join a session and load the first level's terrain. This builds on existing multiplayer code without altering Supabase auth yet.

## Assumptions
- Username uniqueness is global (across all active sessions/users); if taken, suggest alternative by appending/incrementing a number (e.g., 'user' -> 'user2').
- Age ranges: 8-12 (Kids), 13-25 (Teens/Young Adults), 26+ (Professionals) as per productContext.md.
- Solo: Treated as a practice round in a private single-player session; competition requires conscious choice and joins a public session (simplest implementation: auto-join existing public or create if none).
- No persistence for guests (session-only data via Socket.io).
- Minimal ties to Supabase for guests; defer full account system integration.
- Always start with Level 1 terrain (load default from database).
- UI: Full page load for the guest form (e.g., a dedicated route/page), then redirect to main game page after successful submission.
- Integrates with existing GameSession in server/server.js and EnhancedMultiplayerManager in src/multiplayer-enhanced.ts.

## Task Breakdown
1. **Server-Side Setup for Guest Users**:
   - Extend GameSession class in server/server.js to include guest user properties (username, ageRange).
   - Add a new Socket.io event (e.g., 'register-guest') to handle username submission, check global uniqueness (e.g., against an in-memory activeUsers Map), and if taken, suggest an alternative (append/increment number) via emit.
   - If unique (or alternative accepted), create a guest player object with temporary ID and emit success.

2. **Client-Side Initial UI**:
   - Create a new full-page UI component/page (e.g., in src/guest-ui.ts or as a new route) for the guest form: input for username, dropdown for age ranges (8-12, 13-25, 26+), toggle/buttons for Solo (practice) or Competition modes.
   - On root URL load in src/main.ts (or via routing), detect first visit (e.g., localStorage flag) and show/load this full page instead of game/auth.
   - Handle server suggestions for usernames (e.g., pre-fill input with suggested alternative).
   - Validate inputs client-side before emitting to server.

3. **Integration with Multiplayer Flow**:
   - On successful registration, use existing multiplayer-enhanced.ts to create/join a session: For solo/practice, create private session; for competition, auto-join existing public session or create one.
   - Emit guest details (including ageRange for difficulty adjustments) to the session and update player lists.
   - After session join, load Level 1 terrain (e.g., via existing loadTerrainFromServer in terrain.ts).
   - Redirect to the main game page/route after setup.

4. **Age Range and Mode Handling**:
   - Store ageRange in player data and use it to adjust gameplay (e.g., simplify objectives/UI for younger ranges via conditional logic).
   - Ensure competition mode requires explicit choice (e.g., default to solo, with a confirmation for switching).

5. **Edge Cases and Polish**:
   - Handle disconnections: Allow rejoin with same username if session active.
   - Add feedback: Loading spinners, error messages (e.g., "Username taken—try {suggestion}").
   - Minimize Supabase calls for guests; no auth integration in this flow.
   - Update memory bank (activeContext.md and progress.md) to note this new guest flow.

6. **Testing**:
   - Manual tests: Simulate first visit, username conflicts/suggestions, mode selection, session join, Level 1 load, redirect.
   - Edge tests: Duplicate usernames, invalid inputs, switching modes, age-based adjustments.

## Potential Risks
- Performance: Global username checks could scale poorly; mitigate with a simple in-memory Map or Redis if needed.
- Security: Guests could spam usernames; add rate limiting on registrations.
- Conflicts with Existing Auth: Ensure this doesn't break Supabase flows; add a "Sign In Instead" button.
- Scope Creep: Stick to no code changes yet—focus on planning.
