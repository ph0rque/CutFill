I want to build an excavator-based game in 3D that helps you excavate a portion of a lot and move it somewhere else (on the lot). One of the goals should be net zero off-lot movement - the volume of dirt that you excavate should remain on the lot so net-zero volume is moved off the lot.

Help me explore and plan out the game. Some initial questions I can think of are:
- Are there games similar to this? 
- What is the UX/UI of such a game?
- How can it be made fun?
- How can it be made multi-player?

This is for an assignment, and the following is the link to the assignment requirements: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qoCTnskm70Vai2B-MAnC0ldvWd_zwaNRqsIWg5nYzug/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.42kgeae2261c

Come up with more questions for me to explore this space and refine my questions if needed.
