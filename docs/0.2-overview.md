# Overview: 3D Cut-and-Fill Earthworks Visualization

This document summarizes a game concept focusing on the 3D visualization of cut-and-fill earthworks, designed for an adult audience of civil engineers, permaculture designers, and other professionals. It draws from the grid method in [Kubla Software's article](https://www.kublasoftware.com/calculating-earthworks-cut-fill-with-a-spreadsheet-grid-method/), focusing on interactive terrain manipulation. The goal is a cerebral game of intellectual mastery: excavate (cut) and relocate (fill) earth on a lot while maintaining a nearly net-zero volume balance, aligning with sustainable engineering and the [assignment's](docs/assigment.md) multiplayer prototyping requirements.

## Core Concept
- **Gameplay Loop**: Interact with a 3D grid-based lot (procedurally generated terrain). Cut from high areas and fill low ones to solve engineering puzzles, with scalable difficulty for different age groups.
- **Core Feeling**: A cerebral game of intellectual mastery, challenging players to find optimal solutions to complex spatial problems.
- **Hazards and Water System**: The terrain is dynamic. Beyond hazards like erosion or landslides (triggered by poor balancing), water is a core puzzle element. Players must sculpt the landscape to manage water flow, create effective drainage, fill reservoirs, or build irrigation channels.
- **Net-Zero Mechanic**: Volumes are auto-calculated, with a flexible tolerance of +/- 5% for completion. The primary feedback is visual and dynamic, though precise numbers are available.
- **Educational Tie-In**: Teaches advanced cut-fill principles via hands-on play, fitting a professional permaculture and civil engineering focus.

## Target Audience

The game is designed to appeal to a broad audience, from young players discovering construction fun to professionals honing engineering skills. It emphasizes educational value through play, with adjustable complexity to suit different users.

- **Multiplayer Option**: Optional competitive or cooperative mode where 2-4 players race or collaborate on the same assignment, suitable for all age groups with appropriate settings.

## Onboarding & Pedagogy
- **Interactive “Dirt-Box” Micro-Tutorial**: A one-minute sandbox at the very start that lets players freely cut and fill while the UI live-highlights volume changes, with age-appropriate guidance.
- **Contextual “Why” Pop-Ups**: Short, first-time tool-tips that explain the engineering rationale behind each mechanic (e.g., net-zero balancing) and fade automatically.
- **Narrative Framing**: Each assignment is wrapped in a simple story to provide professional context. For example, "A farmer needs to create a series of level rice paddies on this hillside that also retain water," making the task feel more purposeful.

## Multiplayer Integration (Optional Mode)
- **Access**: Available as an optional mode after completing solo tutorial levels
- **Session Structure**: Quick 2-15 minute competitive rounds with 2-4 players per lot
- **Competition Format**: Players race or cooperate to complete the same assignment (e.g., level marked area for house foundation) while maintaining net-zero earthworks, with modes for competitive racing or collaborative building.
- **Scoring System**: 
  - Primary: Assignment completion (pass/fail)
  - Secondary: Net-zero achievement (required)
  - Tie-breaker: Speed of completion
  - Bonus points for efficiency (fewer operations to complete)
- **Real-time Collaboration**: All players work simultaneously on shared terrain with live sync
- **Fair Play**: All players start with identical tools and capabilities
- **Dual Visualization**: Combine the color overlay with a translucent 3D “ghost” mesh of the target terrain so players can instantly see both current and desired elevations.
- **Embeddable Metrics Panel**: A collapsible side panel that displays live cut, fill, and net-balance numbers; it turns green when the tolerance is met.
- **Rewind Button**: Allows players to undo the last few actions, encouraging experimentation without heavy penalties.

## Levels and Progression
- **Assignment-Based Structure**: Each level presents a clear construction or landscaping assignment wrapped in a narrative, with scalable complexity for different audiences.
- **Example Assignments**:
  - **Foundation Prep**: Level a marked 10x10 area to within 1-foot elevation variance for a new building.
  - **Drainage Channel**: Create a swale following a marked path to protect a site from storm runoff, while maintaining overall site balance.
  - **Building Pad & Irrigation**: Prepare level areas for multiple structures (house, shed) while designing a functional irrigation system for adjacent garden beds.
  - **Site Preparation**: Clear and level access roads while managing water runoff and ensuring slope stability.
- **Solo Scoring Criteria**: 
  1. Assignment completion (required)
  2. Net-zero achievement within +/- 5% tolerance (required) 
  3. Efficiency rating (based on number of operations)
  4. Star rating system (3 stars for optimal solutions)
- **Multiplayer Scoring**: Adds speed bonus (fastest completion wins) to the above criteria
- **Progressive Complexity**: Later levels introduce multiple assignments, tighter tolerances, and environmental hazards

## Educational Tracking and Assessment
- **Learning Outcomes Monitoring**: Track player understanding of cut-fill principles through gameplay metrics.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Volume estimation accuracy (before vs. after completion)
  - Water management effectiveness (e.g., reservoir fill rate, drainage efficiency)
  - Strategy improvement over time (fewer unnecessary operations)
  - Hazard response learning (better reaction to erosion/stability issues)
  - Understanding of soil types and their properties

- **Performance Analytics**: Track common mistakes and provide targeted feedback

## UX/UI Design
- **3D Visualization**: Isometric or 2.5D views with drag-to-edit cells; real-time dirt flow animations, with customizable styles (e.g., cartoonish for kids, realistic for pros).
- **Feedback**: Color overlays that are semi-transparent (red for cut-excess, blue for fill-needed) and a tipping balance meter
- **Accessibility**: Simple gestures, customizable views, and difficulty settings for all ages.
- **Assignment Overlay**: Highlighted target areas and completion progress indicators
- **Multiplayer Indicators**: (Optional mode only) Clear visual distinction between players' actions and current tool ownership

## Making It Fun
