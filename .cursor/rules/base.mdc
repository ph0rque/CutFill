# CutFill Game Development Rules

## Project Context
This is a 7-day AI-accelerated game development challenge creating a 3D cut-and-fill earthworks educational game. The project emphasizes rapid learning, iterative development, and production-quality results.

## Development Philosophy
- **AI-First Learning**: Leverage AI for rapid technology adoption and problem-solving
- **Educational Focus**: Every feature must serve the educational mission
- **Multiplayer Core**: Real-time synchronization is a fundamental requirement
- **Performance Priority**: 60 FPS and <100ms latency are non-negotiable
- **Scope Discipline**: Strict MVP focus with clear future enhancement path

## Code Quality Standards
- **Documentation**: Every major function and class must have clear documentation
- **Testing**: Critical calculations (volume, terrain) require unit tests
- **Performance**: Profile early and optimize throughout development
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting and AI-readable

## File Organization
- **Memory Bank**: Complete project documentation in `memory-bank/`
- **Source Code**: Clean separation of client and server code
- **Assets**: Optimized 3D models and textures under size constraints
- **Tests**: Co-located with source code for easy maintenance

## AI Utilization Patterns
- **Research**: Use AI for technology comparison and selection
- **Implementation**: AI-assisted code generation for boilerplate
- **Debugging**: AI-powered problem diagnosis and optimization
- **Documentation**: AI-maintained technical documentation

## Technical Constraints
- **Web Platform**: Browser-only deployment target
- **Three.js**: Primary 3D graphics library
- **Socket.io**: Real-time multiplayer communication
- **Supabase**: Authentication, database, and real-time subscriptions
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment
- **Self-contained Development**: Minimal external dependencies

## Success Metrics
- **Functional Multiplayer**: 4-player real-time sessions
- **Educational Value**: Measurable learning outcomes
- **Production Quality**: Polished and bug-free experience
- **Development Velocity**: Rapid prototype to production timeline
