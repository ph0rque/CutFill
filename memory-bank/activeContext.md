- **Cross-Section Profiles**: âœ… Straight (90Â°), curved (radius=depth/2), and angled (45Â°) wall options
- **Smart Elevation Calculation**: âœ… Automatic highest/lowest point detection for cut/fill operations

#### Workflow Implementation - TESTED AND WORKING
1. **Direction Selection**: âœ… Clear emphasis on cut (down) vs fill (up) with visual distinction
2. **Magnitude Configuration**: âœ… Relative depth/height specification with preset and custom values
3. **Area Definition**: âœ… Working correctly
   - **Polygon Mode**: âœ… Click vertices to define custom shapes with intersection handling
   - **Polyline Mode**: âœ… Linear excavation with visual and numeric thickness controls
4. **Cross-Section Setup**: âœ… Wall type selection and deepest point positioning
5. **3D Preview**: âœ… Real-time visualization with translucent operation preview
6. **Execution**: âœ… One-click application with volume tracking integration

#### Technical Integration - SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED
- **Terrain Integration**: âœ… Added `modifyHeightAtPosition()` method for precise vertex manipulation

- **Simplified Main Loop**: âœ… Created `main-precision.ts` focused on new workflow
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: âœ… Custom events for workflow state synchronization
- **Geometric Algorithms**: âœ… Point-in-polygon testing, line segment distance calculations
- **Rendering Issues**: âœ… Resolved black screen issue with improved camera positioning and lighting
- **Import/Export Issues**: âœ… Fixed TypeScript interface imports with proper type-only imports

#### User Experience - VALIDATED
- **Intuitive Workflow**: âœ… Users guided through each step with progress indicators
- **Professional Interface**: âœ… CAD-like precision tools working correctly
- **Real-time Feedback**: âœ… Visual previews and volume calculations operational
- **Camera Controls**: âœ… Mac-optimized controls working (left-drag rotate, scroll zoom)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: âœ… All shortcuts functional (Enter, Escape, R, G, D for debug)

### STABLE FEATURES: Complete Cut/Fill Visualization System
- **Cut Visualization**: Red semitransparent overlay (50% opacity) showing original terrain ONLY in excavated areas
- **Fill Visualization**: Blue semitransparent overlay showing filled volume ONLY in areas with added material
- **Auto-Enabled on Modifications**: Overlays are hidden on fresh terrain but automatically enabled when cut/fill operations occur
- **Selective Overlay Display**: Overlays only appear where actual cut/fill operations have occurred (>0.1 ft change)
- **Smart Arrow Positioning**: Cut arrows (red, 6.0 length) positioned inside excavated volume, fill arrows (blue, 6.0 length) positioned inside filled volume
- **Grayscale Terrain**: Surface and walls use height-based grayscale from #444 (deep/dark) to #DDD (high/light)
- **Flat Shading**: All materials use MeshBasicMaterial for minimal lighting and clean technical appearance
- **Dynamic Updates**: Both overlays and grayscale coloring update in real-time as terrain is modified
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Overlays positioned higher above terrain (0.5-0.6 units) for better visibility
- **UI Controls**: "Show Original" and "Show Fill" toggle buttons (green when hidden, colored when shown) with automatic state synchronization
- **Technical**: Uses RGBA vertex colors with alpha transparency for precise selective visibility

### Previous Enhancement: Dynamic Volume Updates After Save Operations
- **Forced Volume Updates**: Volume display immediately updates after each Save/Enter operation with cumulative totals
- **Visual Confirmation**: Green notification "ðŸ“Š Volume totals updated!" appears after each save to confirm update
- **Real-time Accumulation**: Cut and fill volumes now properly accumulate with each executed plan
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see updated volumes instantly after committing planned operations
- **Dual Implementation**: Works consistently for both Save button clicks and Enter key presses

### Previous Fix: Volume Calculation Initialization 
- **Zero Initialization**: Volume display now properly shows 0.00 ydÂ³ for cut and fill on fresh page load
- **Precision Handling**: Added 0.001 ydÂ³ threshold to eliminate floating point precision noise
- **Forced Update**: Initial volume display update called during game initialization
- **Negative Value Protection**: Math.max(0, value) ensures cut/fill volumes never show negative
- **Clean Fresh State**: Unmodified terrain now correctly displays 0.00 cut, 0.00 fill, 0.00 net

### Next Priorities
1. âœ… **User Testing**: Successfully tested the complete precision workflow
2. **Feature Enhancements**: Consider additional cross-section profiles or advanced measurement tools
3. **User Experience**: Gather feedback on workflow efficiency and usability
4. **Performance**: Monitor geometric operations performance with complex shapes
