## Current Focus (January 15, 2025)

### Recent Major Bug Fix: Fill Tool Operation
- **Issue**: Fill tool was showing blue arrows and removing material instead of green arrows and adding material
- **Root Cause**: Double multiplication in brush settings and incorrect arrow color
- **Fixed**: 
  - FillTool now uses `Math.abs(fillStrength)` in brush settings to match CutTool pattern
  - Fill arrows now use green color (0x44AA44) instead of red to match tool color scheme
- **Result**: Fill tool now correctly shows green upward arrows and adds material to terrain

### Tool System Status
- **Cut Tool (⛏️)**: Red color scheme, creates blue downward arrows, removes earth
- **Fill Tool (🏔️)**: Green color scheme, creates green upward arrows, adds earth
- Both tools support persistent session arrows with granular management controls
- Keyboard shortcuts: Q=Cut, E=Fill
- Professional volumetric operation previews with translucent 3D volumes

### Arrow Management System
- **Persistent Arrows**: Both cut and fill arrows persist for entire session
- **Granular Controls**: Separate counts, Clear Cut/Fill/All, Hide/Show buttons  
- **UI Display**: "⛏️ Cut: X", "🏔️ Fill: Y", "Total: Z" with management buttons
- **Color-Coded**: Blue arrows for cuts, green arrows for fills

### Volume Analysis & Tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Throttled volume analysis during operations (100ms intervals)
- **Activity Detection**: Shows "🔄 Active" vs "⏸️ Idle" status with rate calculations
- **Cubic Yards**: All volumes displayed in yd³ (converted from ft³ using 1 yd³ = 27 ft³)
- **Progress Integration**: Tracks cubic yards moved for achievements and progress
- **Smart Thresholds**: Balance status uses yd³-appropriate thresholds (<0.1 yd³ balanced)

### Next Priorities
1. **User Testing**: Verify all tools work correctly with recent bug fixes
2. **Performance**: Monitor frame rates with persistent arrow accumulation
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider slope analysis or material cost calculations

## Implementation Notes

### Recent Technical Changes
- Fixed double multiplication bug in FillTool.apply() method
- Corrected fill arrow color from red to green for consistency
- Maintained proper brush settings pattern across both tools
- All volume systems now use cubic yards as requested

### System Architecture
- **Terrain**: Solid 3D blocks with Y-up coordinate system, 100ft x 100ft plots
- **Materials**: Realistic layered geology (topsoil, subsoil, clay, rock) visible in cross-section
- **Controls**: Mac-optimized with trackpad gestures (two-finger zoom, left-drag rotate)
- **Multiplayer**: WebSocket-based real-time collaboration ready
- **Performance**: Optimized for persistent arrow accumulation and real-time updates
