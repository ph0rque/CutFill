# Active Context

## Current Focus (January 15, 2025)

### NEW FEATURE: Complete Cut/Fill Visualization System with Flat Shaded Grayscale Terrain
- **Cut Visualization**: Red semitransparent overlay (50% opacity) showing original terrain ONLY in excavated areas
- **Fill Visualization**: Blue semitransparent overlay showing filled volume ONLY in areas with added material
- **Auto-Enabled on Modifications**: Overlays are hidden on fresh terrain but automatically enabled when cut/fill operations occur
- **Selective Overlay Display**: Overlays only appear where actual cut/fill operations have occurred (>0.1 ft change)
- **Smart Arrow Positioning**: Cut arrows (red, 6.0 length) positioned inside excavated volume, fill arrows (blue, 6.0 length) positioned inside filled volume
- **Grayscale Terrain**: Surface and walls use height-based grayscale from #444 (deep/dark) to #DDD (high/light)
- **Flat Shading**: All materials use MeshBasicMaterial for minimal lighting and clean technical appearance
- **Dynamic Updates**: Both overlays and grayscale coloring update in real-time as terrain is modified
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Overlays positioned higher above terrain (0.5-0.6 units) for better visibility
- **UI Controls**: "Show Original" and "Show Fill" toggle buttons (green when hidden, colored when shown) with automatic state synchronization
- **Technical**: Uses RGBA vertex colors with alpha transparency for precise selective visibility

### Tool System Status (Enhanced with Flat Shading)
- **Cut Tool (‚õèÔ∏è)**: Red color scheme, creates red downward arrows positioned in excavated volume, shows red overlay
- **Fill Tool (üèîÔ∏è)**: Green color scheme, creates blue upward arrows positioned in filled volume, shows blue overlay
- **Visual Overlays**: Red overlay shows original terrain surface, blue overlay shows filled material
- **Flat Shading**: All terrain materials use MeshBasicMaterial for minimal lighting and flat technical appearance
- Both tools support persistent session arrows with granular management controls
- Keyboard shortcuts: Q=Cut, E=Fill
- Professional volumetric operation previews with translucent 3D volumes

### Arrow Management System (Complete with Zoom-Based Density)
- **Persistent Arrows**: Both cut and fill arrows persist for entire session
- **Smart Cut Arrows**: Red arrows positioned inside excavated volume (between original and current terrain)
- **Smart Fill Arrows**: Blue arrows positioned inside filled volume (between original and current terrain)
- **Fixed Arrow Size**: All arrows maintain consistent size (6.0 length, 2.0 head, 1.0 width) regardless of zoom level
- **Zoom-Based Density**: Fewer, larger arrows when zoomed in (max 8 arrows), very few when zoomed out (0.3x density)
- **Smart Spacing**: Arrow spacing adjusts automatically based on brush size and zoom density
- **Granular Controls**: Separate counts, Clear Cut/Fill/All, Hide/Show buttons, Show/Hide overlays
- **UI Display**: "‚õèÔ∏è Cut: X", "üèîÔ∏è Fill: Y", "Total: Z" with management buttons + overlay toggles
- **Color-Coded**: Red arrows for cuts (inside excavated volume), blue arrows for fills (inside filled volume)

### Volume Analysis & Tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Throttled volume analysis during operations (100ms intervals)
- **Activity Detection**: Shows "üîÑ Active" vs "‚è∏Ô∏è Idle" status with rate calculations
- **Cubic Yards**: All volumes displayed in yd¬≥ (converted from ft¬≥ using 1 yd¬≥ = 27 ft¬≥)
- **Progress Integration**: Tracks cubic yards moved for achievements and progress
- **Smart Thresholds**: Balance status uses yd¬≥-appropriate thresholds (<0.1 yd¬≥ balanced)

### Next Priorities
1. **User Testing**: Verify all tools work correctly with recent bug fixes
2. **Performance**: Monitor frame rates with persistent arrow accumulation
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider slope analysis or material cost calculations

## Implementation Notes

### Recent Technical Changes
- Fixed double multiplication bug in FillTool.apply() method
- Corrected fill arrow color from red to green for consistency
- Maintained proper brush settings pattern across both tools
- All volume systems now use cubic yards as requested

### System Architecture
- **Terrain**: Solid 3D blocks with Y-up coordinate system, 100ft x 100ft plots
- **Materials**: Realistic layered geology (topsoil, subsoil, clay, rock) visible in cross-section
- **Controls**: Mac-optimized with trackpad gestures (two-finger zoom, left-drag rotate)
- **Multiplayer**: WebSocket-based real-time collaboration ready
- **Performance**: Optimized for persistent arrow accumulation and real-time updates
