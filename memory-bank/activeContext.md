# Active Context

## Current Focus: **TERRAIN DIMENSIONS UPDATED TO EVEN YARD NUMBERS** ✅

### Just Completed: Even Terrain Dimensions 
The CutFill game terrain has been updated to use more even numbers in yards: **40×40 yards lot with 10 yard depth**, making calculations and measurements more intuitive for professional use.

## Key Changes in This Session

### 📏 **Terrain Dimension Standardization** (Just Completed)
**Problem**: Previous terrain was 33.3×33.3 yards (100×100 feet), creating awkward fractional measurements.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Lot Size**: Updated to exactly **40×40 yards** (120×120 feet)
- **Lot Depth**: Updated to exactly **10 yards** (30 feet) 
- **Work Area**: Now a clean **1,600 square yards** (vs previous 1,111 yd²)
- **Volume**: Maximum excavation now **16,000 cubic yards** capacity

### 🔧 **Technical Updates**:
1. **Terrain Class**: Updated constructor to use 120×120 internal units
2. **Coordinate System**: All hardcoded references updated (axis ranges, bounds checking, center points)
3. **UI Displays**: Updated terrain stats to show "40 × 40 yd" and "1,600 yd²"
4. **Database Migration**: Created migration to update existing terrain configurations
5. **API Integration**: Updated terrain save/load operations to use new dimensions

### 🎯 **User Experience Benefits**:
- **Cleaner Numbers**: All measurements now use whole or half-yard increments
- **Professional Standards**: 40×40 yard lots are common in construction industry
- **Easier Calculations**: Volume calculations work with round numbers
- **Consistent Display**: All UI elements now show exact yard measurements

## Previous Achievements

### 🌍 **Terrain Persistence System** (Complete)
**Problem Solved**: Previously, each level generated random terrain, making it difficult for players to develop strategies and compare performance.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Database Schema**: Created `level_terrains` table with JSONB storage for terrain data
2. **Server API**: 6 comprehensive endpoints for terrain management:
   - `GET /api/terrain/:levelId` - Load terrain for level
   - `POST /api/terrain/save` - Save new terrain configuration  
   - `PUT /api/terrain/:terrainId` - Update existing terrain
   - `DELETE /api/terrain/:terrainId` - Delete terrain configuration
   - `GET /api/terrain/list/:levelId` - List all terrains for level
3. **Frontend Integration**: Modified `AssignmentManager` to load saved terrains
4. **Terrain Class**: Added server persistence methods
5. **Default Configurations**: Pre-populated terrains for levels 1-3

### 📏 **Yard Measurement Conversion** (Complete)
**Change Made**: Converted all terrain measurements from feet to yards (1 yard = 3 feet) for professional consistency.

**Updated Components**:
- **Terrain Generation**: All height variations now in yards (±0.5 to ±3.33 yards)
- **Material Layers**: Depths converted (topsoil: 0.08 yards, subsoil: 0.92 yards, etc.)
- **Database Configs**: Updated default terrain descriptions and parameters
- **UI Labels**: All depth/height displays show yard measurements
- **Cut/Fill Limits**: Maximum operations now 6.67 yards (was 20 feet)
