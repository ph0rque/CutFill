## Current Focus

### LATEST IMPROVEMENTS: Terrain Generation & Scale Reference System

#### Volume Calculation Fix for Terrain Generation
- **Fixed Terrain Regeneration**: `regenerateTerrain()` now properly resets `originalVertices` array
- **Accurate Volume Display**: New terrain correctly shows 0.00 yd¬≥ cut and fill (was showing incorrect previous values)
- **Generation Notification**: Press 'G' shows "üåç New terrain generated!" confirmation
- **Immediate Volume Update**: Volume display immediately resets to 0.00/0.00 when new terrain is generated
- **Realistic Terrain Patterns**: 5 different patterns (flat, gentle_slope, valley, hill, rolling) with natural mathematical curves

#### Clean Scale Reference System
- **Minimal Coordinate Markers**: Yellow markers at 50-foot intervals with coordinate labels (X',Z')
- **Clean Visual Design**: Removed grid lines and dimensional arrows per user preference
- **Coordinate System**: Clear markers at terrain perimeter showing distance in feet
- **No Visual Clutter**: Simple, unobtrusive scale reference without busy visual elements

### STABLE FEATURES: Complete Cut/Fill Visualization System
- **Cut Visualization**: Red semitransparent overlay (50% opacity) showing original terrain ONLY in excavated areas
- **Fill Visualization**: Blue semitransparent overlay showing filled volume ONLY in areas with added material
- **Auto-Enabled on Modifications**: Overlays are hidden on fresh terrain but automatically enabled when cut/fill operations occur
- **Selective Overlay Display**: Overlays only appear where actual cut/fill operations have occurred (>0.1 ft change)
- **Smart Arrow Positioning**: Cut arrows (red, 6.0 length) positioned inside excavated volume, fill arrows (blue, 6.0 length) positioned inside filled volume
- **Grayscale Terrain**: Surface and walls use height-based grayscale from #444 (deep/dark) to #DDD (high/light)
- **Flat Shading**: All materials use MeshBasicMaterial for minimal lighting and clean technical appearance
- **Dynamic Updates**: Both overlays and grayscale coloring update in real-time as terrain is modified
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Overlays positioned higher above terrain (0.5-0.6 units) for better visibility
- **UI Controls**: "Show Original" and "Show Fill" toggle buttons (green when hidden, colored when shown) with automatic state synchronization
- **Technical**: Uses RGBA vertex colors with alpha transparency for precise selective visibility

### Tool System Status (Enhanced with Flat Shading)
- **Cut Tool (‚õèÔ∏è)**: Red color scheme, creates red downward arrows positioned in excavated volume, shows red overlay
- **Fill Tool (üèîÔ∏è)**: Green color scheme, creates blue upward arrows positioned in filled volume, shows blue overlay
- **Visual Overlays**: Red overlay shows original terrain surface, blue overlay shows filled material
- **Flat Shading**: All terrain materials use MeshBasicMaterial for minimal lighting and flat technical appearance
- Both tools support persistent session arrows with granular management controls
- Keyboard shortcuts: Q=Cut, E=Fill
- Professional volumetric operation previews with translucent 3D volumes

### Arrow Management System (Complete with Zoom-Based Density)
- **Persistent Arrows**: Both cut and fill arrows persist for entire session
- **Smart Cut Arrows**: Red arrows positioned inside excavated volume (between original and current terrain)
- **Smart Fill Arrows**: Blue arrows positioned inside filled volume (between original and current terrain)
- **Fixed Arrow Size**: All arrows maintain consistent size (6.0 length, 2.0 head, 1.0 width) regardless of zoom level
- **Zoom-Based Density**: Fewer, larger arrows when zoomed in (max 8 arrows), very few when zoomed out (0.3x density)
- **Smart Spacing**: Arrow spacing adjusts automatically based on brush size and zoom density
- **Granular Controls**: Separate counts, Clear Cut/Fill/All, Hide/Show buttons, Show/Hide overlays
- **UI Display**: "‚õèÔ∏è Cut: X", "üèîÔ∏è Fill: Y", "Total: Z" with management buttons + overlay toggles
- **Color-Coded**: Red arrows for cuts (inside excavated volume), blue arrows for fills (inside filled volume)

### Volume Analysis & Tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Throttled volume analysis during operations (100ms intervals)
- **Activity Detection**: Shows "üîÑ Active" vs "‚è∏Ô∏è Idle" status with rate calculations
- **Cubic Yards**: All volumes displayed in yd¬≥ (converted from ft¬≥ using 1 yd¬≥ = 27 ft¬≥)
- **Progress Integration**: Tracks cubic yards moved for achievements and progress
- **Smart Thresholds**: Balance status uses yd¬≥-appropriate thresholds (<0.1 yd¬≥ balanced)

### Previous Enhancement: Dynamic Volume Updates After Save Operations
- **Forced Volume Updates**: Volume display immediately updates after each Save/Enter operation with cumulative totals
- **Visual Confirmation**: Green notification "üìä Volume totals updated!" appears after each save to confirm update
- **Real-time Accumulation**: Cut and fill volumes now properly accumulate with each executed plan
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see updated volumes instantly after committing planned operations
- **Dual Implementation**: Works consistently for both Save button clicks and Enter key presses

### Previous Fix: Volume Calculation Initialization 
- **Zero Initialization**: Volume display now properly shows 0.00 yd¬≥ for cut and fill on fresh page load
- **Precision Handling**: Added 0.001 yd¬≥ threshold to eliminate floating point precision noise
- **Forced Update**: Initial volume display update called during game initialization
- **Negative Value Protection**: Math.max(0, value) ensures cut/fill volumes never show negative
- **Clean Fresh State**: Unmodified terrain now correctly displays 0.00 cut, 0.00 fill, 0.00 net

### Previous UI Enhancement: Processing Indicator for Plan Execution
- **Visual Feedback**: Added animated spinner with "Processing terrain changes..." message during plan execution
- **Dual Implementation**: Shows for both Save button clicks and Enter key presses
- **Professional Appearance**: Centered modal with green spinner, dark background, and smooth animations
- **Responsive Timing**: Uses setTimeout to ensure UI updates before terrain processing begins
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Indicator automatically disappears when processing is complete

### Previous UI Fix: Enhanced Tooltip Hiding During Modification Mode (Improved)
- **Immediate Ctrl Detection**: Added keydown event listener to hide tooltips instantly when Ctrl is pressed
- **Dual Detection System**: Both mousemove and keydown events check for Ctrl key
- **Complete Label Hiding**: Labels disappear both when cut/fill tools are selected AND when Ctrl is pressed
- **Clean Modification Experience**: No label interference during Ctrl+drag operations
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with both Ctrl (PC) and Cmd (Mac) keys
- **Instant Response**: Tooltips hide immediately when Ctrl is pressed, not just on mouse movement

### Previous Enhancement: Return/Enter Hotkey for Plan Execution
- **Return Key Hotkey**: Added Enter/Return key to save and execute planned cut/fill operations
- **Seamless Workflow**: Users can plan operations with Ctrl+drag, then press Enter to commit changes
- **UI Integration**: Hotkey info added to keyboard controls help section
- **Smart Execution**: Only executes when there are pending planned operations
- **UI Updates**: Automatically refreshes planning buttons and volume display after execution

### Previous Feature: 5-Foot Depth/Height Limits for Cut/Fill Operations
- **Cut Limits**: Cut operations are limited to maximum 5 feet below original terrain height
- **Fill Limits**: Fill operations are limited to maximum 5 feet above original terrain height  
- **No Overlap Beyond Limits**: Prevents overlapping operations that would exceed these depth/height limits
- **Smart Visual Feedback**: Tooltips show remaining cut/fill capacity and warn when limits are reached
- **Real-time Limit Checking**: Uses `getDepthLimitsAtPosition()` to check current depth relative to original terrain
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `modifyHeightBrush()` with limit checking against `originalVertices` array

### Previous UI Enhancement: Hidden Labels During Cut/Fill Operations
- **Smart Label Hiding**: Terrain tooltips are now hidden when cut or fill tools are engaged (selected)
- **Cleaner Interface**: No more overlapping tooltips during cut/fill operations for better focus
- **Preserved Functionality**: Labels still appear normally when other tools are selected or when not using cut/fill tools
- **Implementation**: Added tool engagement detection in mousemove handler to hide terrain-tooltip element

### Next Priorities
1. **User Testing**: Verify all tools work correctly with recent bug fixes including new label hiding
2. **Performance**: Monitor frame rates with persistent arrow accumulation
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider slope analysis or material cost calculations
