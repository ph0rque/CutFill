# CutFill Game Project Brief

## Project Overview
CutFill is a 3D excavator-based game that teaches cut-and-fill earthworks principles through interactive gameplay. Players excavate portions of terrain and relocate earth while maintaining net-zero off-lot movement, combining educational value with engaging gameplay.

## Core Mission
Build a web-based multiplayer game that makes earthworks engineering accessible and fun for multiple audiences, from children to civil engineering professionals.

## Key Requirements

### Gameplay Requirements
- **Net-Zero Mechanic**: Volume of excavated dirt must remain on-lot (Â±5% tolerance)
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive grid-based terrain manipulation
- **Educational Focus**: Teach cut-and-fill principles through hands-on play
- **Water Management**: Dynamic water flow, drainage, and hazard systems
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Scalable complexity for different age groups

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Web browser using Three.js for 3D visualization
- **Multiplayer**: Real-time synchronization for 2-4 players
- **Performance**: Low latency, high performance with no lag
- **Timeline**: 7-day development challenge using AI-accelerated learning

### Success Criteria
- Functional multiplayer game in unfamiliar tech stack
- Educational value demonstrable across age groups
- Fun, engaging gameplay with clear objectives
- Production-quality polish and performance
- Effective AI utilization throughout development

## Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Single web platform, core earthworks mechanics, basic multiplayer
- **Out of Scope**: Mobile apps, advanced AR features, real-world integration
- **Future Vision**: Integration into broader permaculture design suite

## Project Context
This is part of a 7-day game development challenge testing ability to rapidly acquire expertise in unfamiliar domains using AI as the primary learning engine.
