# Progress Status

## Current Status: **EVEN TERRAIN DIMENSIONS COMPLETE** ✅

The CutFill game now features professional-grade terrain dimensions using even yard measurements: **40×40 yard lots with 10 yard depth**, providing intuitive measurements for construction industry standards.

---

## Recent Major Achievement: Even Terrain Dimensions

### ✅ **Terrain Dimension Standardization** (Just Completed)
- **Lot Dimensions**: Updated to exactly 40×40 yards (120×120 feet internally)
- **Lot Depth**: Standardized to 10 yards (30 feet) for clean excavation limits
- **Work Area**: Now precisely 1,600 square yards (vs previous awkward 1,111 yd²)
- **Coordinate System**: All axis ranges, bounds, and center points updated
- **Database Migration**: Updated stored terrain configurations to new dimensions
- **UI Consistency**: All displays now show round yard measurements

### Key Benefits:
- **Professional Standards**: 40×40 yard lots align with industry norms
- **Clean Mathematics**: Volume calculations use round numbers
- **User Experience**: Easier to estimate and plan earthwork operations
- **Consistent Scaling**: All precision tools work with even increments

## Previous Major Achievement: Terrain Persistence & Yard Conversion

### ✅ **Terrain Persistence System** (Complete)
- **Database Schema**: Created `level_terrains` table for storing terrain configurations
- **Server API**: 6 new endpoints for terrain management (save, load, list, delete, update)
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated `AssignmentManager` to load saved terrains instead of random generation
- **Terrain Class**: Added server persistence methods (`loadTerrainFromServer`, `saveTerrainToServer`)
- **Default Configurations**: Pre-populated default terrains for levels 1-3
- **Measurement Units**: Converted all terrain measurements from feet to yards (1 yard = 3 feet)

### Key Benefits:
- **Consistent Experience**: Each level now uses the same terrain configuration every time
- **Performance**: Reduced terrain generation overhead
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new terrain variations per level
- **User Experience**: Predictable terrain allows players to develop strategies
- **Measurement Standard**: All terrain heights and depths now in yards for consistency
