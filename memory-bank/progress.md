- **Frontend Integration**: Updated `AssignmentManager` to load saved terrains instead of random generation
- **Terrain Class**: Added server persistence methods (`loadTerrainFromServer`, `saveTerrainToServer`)
- **Default Configurations**: Pre-populated default terrains for levels 1-3
- **Measurement Units**: Converted all terrain measurements from feet to yards (1 yard = 3 feet)

### Key Benefits:
- **Consistent Experience**: Each level now uses the same terrain configuration every time
- **Performance**: Reduced terrain generation overhead
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new terrain variations per level
- **User Experience**: Predictable terrain allows players to develop strategies
